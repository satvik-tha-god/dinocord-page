## Inspiration
Fascinated by the beings that roamed this Earth million of years ago and dismayed by the lack of due interest. We present you- Dinocord!

## What it does

Dinocord is a discord bot for aspiring paleontologists and pre-historic enthusiasts. With many fun features and useful tools. this powerful #1 bot for all of your dino needs!
It has the following features:
1. Sends dinosaur memes!
2. Myths vs Facts game: the user is prompted with text and they have to guess if it's a myth or a fact

## How we built it

1.  Used HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap to create the homepage
2.  We used the Discord.js package to create a discord bot with Node.js
3. Used Google Cloud Platform's AutoML to implement the classification model
